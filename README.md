Iberian Peninsula Holocene climates

The results of the paper Holocene climates of the Iberian Peninsula: pollen-based reconstructions of changes in the west-east gradient of temperature and moisture can be reproduced using the codes and data provided.

Input: Modern_Pollen_gdd_alpha_Tmin.csv is the modern training data set; Iberia_pollen_records_v3_0307.xlsx is the fossil record.
Output: Iberian_core_sig.csv is the reconstructed climate, while Iberian_sse_core_sig.csv is the sample specific error of the reconstructed climate, sharing the same order with Iberian_core_sig.csv.
